# DevSecOps-Lab
# WORK IN PROGRESS

A DevSecOps Lab, that helps to learn 'Activities' described in DSOMM (DevSecOps Maturity Model by OWASP) -> https://dsomm.timo-pagel.de/

## What I want this to be:
- Concentrated on Being **Free!** and to be running **Locally** <- This can be really hard to achieve, especially when most DevSecOps features are provided by the Cloud, and also that there're many problems **especially problematic on the Cloud**, like **Access Controls**
